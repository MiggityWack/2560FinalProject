As of 12/4 at 10:55 PM the code is officially done to be submitted. The C++ code and the QT code are in their separate folders
In order to run CPP files simply download and run
In order to run QT files, QT will be needed, but the CMake is included so it all should import cleanly
Final Presentation and Report are in their own folder
Anything outside of the folders is, for the most part, unneeded relics as I am too unfamiliar with Github to keep it all clean without removing the living proof of the editing process
